  ABSTRACT =	 {A metalogical framework is a logic with an
                  associated methodology that is used to represent
                  other logics and to reason about their metalogical
                  properties. We propose that logical frameworks can
                  be good metalogical frameworks when their logics
                  support reflective reasoning and their theories
                  always have initial models. We present a concrete
                  realization of this idea in rewriting
                  logic. Theories in rewriting logic always have
                  initial models and this logic supports reflective
                  reasoning. This implies that inductive reasoning is
                  valid when proving properties about the initial
                  models of theories in rewriting logic, and that we
                  can use reflection to reason at the metalevel about
                  these properties. In fact, we can uniformly reflect
                  induction principles for proving metatheorems about
                  rewriting logic theories and their parameterized
                  extensions. We show that this reflective methodology
                  provides an effective framework for different,
                  non-trivial, kinds of formal metatheoretic
                  reasoning; one can, for example, prove metatheorems
                  that relate theories or establish properties of
                  parameterized classes of theories. Finally, we
                  report on the implementation of an inductive theorem
                  prover in the Maude system, whose design is based on
                  the results presented in this paper.}

                  the user, as can already be observed with the still
                  rather simple type systems currently in use
                  e.g.\null{} in Haskell or ML: error messages
                  signaling type errors frequently give complex types
                  and little clue where the real source of the error
                  is. We present a class of typing systems that are
                  designed for online use, preventing input of
                  untypeable constructs and guiding the user through
                  the construction of programs with complex
                  types. Since this implies making explicit the
                  relation between programs and their types, the
                  choice formalism for this purpose is that of term
                  graphs, where much more program structure can
                  usefully be made explicit than in linear
                  notations. After presenting a framework for the
                  definition of typing systems in term graphs, we
                  discuss the advantages of this approach and sketch
                  applications to e.g.\null{} polytypic programming.}

                  the polytypic and monadic programming styles, by
                  introducing a new kind of combinator, called a
                  traversal. The natural setting for defining
                  traversals is the class of shapely data types. This
                  result reinforces the view that shapely data types
                  form a natural domain for polytypism: they include
                  most of the data types of interest, while to exceed
                  them would sacrifice a very smooth interaction
                  between polytypic and monadic programming.},

                  a functional program's execution include some
                  intensional information about, for example, the

@ARTICLE{Sands:TOPLAS,
  author =	 {D. Sands},
  title =	 {Total Correctness by Local Improvement in the
                  Transformation of Functional Programs},
  journal =	 {ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and
                  Systems (TOPLAS)},
  year =	 1996,
  volume =	 18,
  number =	 2,
  month =	 {March},
  pages =	 {175--234},
  summary =	 {The goal of program transformation is to improve
                  efficiency while preserving meaning. One of the
                  best-known transformation techniques is Burstall and
                  Darlington's unfold-fold method. Unfortunately the
                  unfold-fold method itself guarantees neither
                  improvement in efficiency nor total correctness. The
                  correctness problem for unfold-fold is an instance
                  of a strictly more general problem: transformation
                  by locally equivalence-preserving steps does not
                  necessarily preserve (global) equivalence. This
                  article presents a condition for the total
                  correctness of transformations on recursive
                  programs, which, for the first time, deals with
                  higher-order functional languages (both strict and
                  nonstrict) including lazy data structures. The main
                  technical result is an improvement theorem which
                  says that if the local transformation steps are
                  guided by certain optimization concerns (a fairly
                  natural condition for a transformation), then
                  correctness of the transformation follows. The
                  improvement theorem makes essential use of a
                  formalized improvement theory; as a rather pleasing
                  corollary it also guarantees that the transformed
                  program is a formal improvement over the
                  original. The theorem has immediate practical
                  consequences: it is a powerful tool for proving the
                  correctness of existing transformation methods for
                  higher-order functional programs, without having to
                  ignore crucial factors such as memoization or
                  folding, and it yields a simple syntactic method for
                  guiding and constraining the unfold-fold method in
                  the general case so that total correctness (and
                  improvement) is always guaranteed. },

  ABSTRACT =	 {In a language with non-parametric or ad-hoc
                  polymorphism, it is possible to determine the
                  identity of a type variable at run time. With this
                  facility, we can write a function to convert a term
                  from one abstract type to another, if the two hidden
                  types are identical. However, the naive
                  implementation of this function requires that the
                  term be destructed and rebuilt. In this paper, we
                  show how to eliminate this overhead using
                  higher-order type abstraction. We demonstrate this
                  solution in two frameworks for ad-hoc polymorphism:
                  intensional type analysis and type classes.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Languages for intensional type analysis permit
                  ad-hoc polymorphism, or run-time analysis of
                  types. However, such languages require complex,
                  specialized constructs to support this operation,
                  which hinder optimization and complicate the
                  meta-theory of these languages. In this paper, we
                  observe that such specialized operators need not be
                  intrinsic to the language, and in fact, their
                  operation may be simulated through standard
                  encodings of iteration in the polymorphic lambda
                  calculus. Therefore, we may more easily add
                  intensional analysis operators to complicated
                  languages via a translation semantics, instead of
                  through language extension.}

  title =	 {{STLlint}: Lifting static checking from languages to
                  libraries},
  journal =	 {Software: Practice \& Experience},
  year =	 2006,
  volume =	 36,
  pages =	 {225--254},
  annote =	 {Traditional static checking centers around finding
                  bugs in programs by isolating cases where the
                  language has been used incorrectly. These
                  language-based checkers do not understand the
                  semantics of software libraries, and therefore
                  cannot be used to detect errors in the use of
                  libraries. In this paper, we introduce STLlint, a
                  program analysis we have implemented for the C++
                  Standard Template Library and similar, generic
                  software libraries, and we present the general
                  approach that underlies STLlint. We show that static
                  checking of library semantics differs greatly from
                  checking of language semantics, requiring new
                  representations of program behavior and new
                  algorithms. Major challenges include checking the
                  use of generic algorithms, loop analysis for
                  interfaces, and organizing behavioral specifications
                  for extensibility.},
